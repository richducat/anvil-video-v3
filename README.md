# Anvil Video V3

This repository contains the Anvil video-style React application. It provides a user-friendly interface for generating metal songs, previewing sections, mixing instruments, and exporting audio. The project uses Vite, React, and Tailwind CSS.

## Deploying to GitHub Pages

The Vite build is configured to emit static assets to the `docs` directory so GitHub Pages can serve the compiled site. Run `npm run build` and push the generated `docs` output, then point GitHub Pages to the `docs/` folder on the `main` branch.
